# Bridge:

## What I learned :

- bridge is like a repeater
- however, a bridge has the ability to read the mac address
- as it can read mac address, this is a layer two device
- it is used to connect two LAN using the same protocol

There are two types of bridges :

- Transparent bridge : we don't have to configure it like a router as the stations are not aware of the bridge's existance .
- Source routing bridge : routing operation is performed by source station and frame specifices which route to follow.
