## USING HUB

- I will be creating a LAN using star topology

### Logging Activities :

- Added a hub 6 ports
- Then i added the 6 computers to the hub to complete the LAN
- Made sure the hub is turned on
- connection is active
- now assinged each pc its ip address so they can uniquely identify each other in the network
- used ipconfig to check if the ip address were assinged
- ip are good to go .
- ran simulation
- when one packet of data is sent from the computer , it goes to all the other computer , however, only the recipient accepts it
- after accepting the recipient returns what was acknowledgement to the sender

## What I learned

- Hub is good for small local area network for its cheap cost
- It would work best for creating smaller Air-gapped network .
- However, its bad for larger network because it would send the same packet to the whole network and it would not be efficient.
